OpenVAS Air-Gapped Container

This project provides a Docker container for OpenVAS (Greenbone Vulnerability Management) built entirely from precompiled binaries, designed for deployment in air-gapped or highly restricted environments. It includes:

- Offline support for NVT, CERT, and SCAP feeds
- PostgreSQL and Redis integration
- Custom entrypoint for automated setup
- Minimal external dependencies

Perfect for secure networks, internal audits, or environments with no internet access.
